# GhidraScripting

A collection of scripts I've personally designed to assist in faster reverse engineering for a number of common scenarios. This README will be updated when I've fleshed out this repository more.

# Personal Background

I'm a student who uses GHIDRA in classroom, CTF, and real world contexts. These scripts are all simple additions to GHIDRA that have been developed in order to make my own life easier.
